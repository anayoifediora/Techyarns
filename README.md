## Project Description
The objective of this project was to develop a Tech Blog for Tech enthusiasts to publish their blog posts and comment on other users posts. The backend includes the database for all Users, Posts and Comments. It also includes *API* routes for users and posts; utilizing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) methodology to perform specific tasks following the user's input.  

The project was developed using *Express.JS* for routing and *MySQL* for database structure. It also incorporated code libraries such as *sequelize*, *express.handlebars*, *node.js* e.t.c. The backend was tested using *Insomnia*. Working on this project exposed me to several new concepts especially the significance of MySQL.
